### **Trying to figure it out how the mind work**
- I write about smart people an smart peolpe are a dime a dozen they don’t usually amount too much

### **What makes people creative**
- what makes them take imaginative leaps
> **That's the key question we must ask**
- what demons are jangling in their head and how do they harness them into drives.
> what is **the key discontent?**
- observe carefully the person of one of the more mundane things I do is a lot of writers try to give you a lot of their opinions and preach
> We need to be a Stroyteller, **not a Preacher**

### **6 magic words for coney a thought; Let me tell you a story**
- If somebody says how does Elon Musk figure out good talent as you did?
    - Well let me tell you the story I’ll tell you the story of Jake Mckenzie.
    - In the beginning,

### **Then it’s stories and secondly to pick up on that lead sentence in the beginning ‘make it chronological’**
- every body in the 40th year of their life has grown from the 39th year and 38th year and so you want to show how people evolve and grow.
- The greatest of all non-fiction narrtive editors Alice Mayhew at Simon Schuster who among other things created all the president’s Men with wood and burns
- but she had a note she’d put in the margin of my books that was a tigta and it meant all things in good time keep it chronological if it’s good enough of the bible it’s good enough for you
- It’s framework for how you structure things but also how you understand things which is
- If you kepp it a chronological narrative then you’re showing how a person has grown from one experience you’ve talked about to the next one.

### **Moral Growth**
- Moral Growth, Wisdom.. etc is the essences of creativity
- but you can’t do it book of that carries a narritives and tells how people learn sth
- im a big believer in narrative if you’re an academic is sometimes not today but in like 20 years ago 30 years ago there were two things you thought were bad
    1. Having a great person history do in which you decided to biography
    2. i had a great professor when I was in college.
        1. when she was going for tenure at the university photobiography of lydon johnson and the american dream and they denied her tenure. because it was beneath the dignity of the academy to write history one person.

### **Biography**
- it’s opened up the field of biography to us non-academics
- Starting with David McCullough, Bob Carroll, John Meacham and Walter Issacson are in a new generation and certainly there’s a generation coming after us
- Second thing beside telling it through people which is the academy tended to disdain what they called imposing a narrative in which you made it storytelling
    - because that meant you were leaving things out making it into a narrative; that’s how we form our views of the world.

### **Observation**
- Q. How much of it is interview?
    - A. depends on the subject. the must book is based much more on observation than almost any of my books beacuse he opened up in a way that was breathtaking to me.
