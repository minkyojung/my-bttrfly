Analyze the codebase for performance optimization opportunities. Look for:
- Unnecessary re-renders in React components
- Inefficient algorithms or data structures
- Memory leaks or excessive memory usage
- Bundle size optimization opportunities
- Database query optimization

Prioritize optimizations by impact and effort required.
